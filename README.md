`AccelByte Gaming Services` (AGS) features can be customized using 
`Extend Override` apps. An `Extend Override` app is basically a `gRPC server` which 
contains one or more custom functions which can be called by AGS instead of the 
default functions.

## Overview

This repository provides a project template to create an `Extend Override` app for `session manager grpc plugin server` written in `Python    `. It includes an example of how the custom functions can be implemented. It also includes the essential `gRPC server` authentication and authorization to ensure security. Additionally, it comes with built-in instrumentation for observability, ensuring that metrics, traces, and logs are available upon deployment.

You can clone this repository to begin developing your own `Extend Override` app for `session manager grpc plugin server`. Simply modify this project by implementing your own logic for the custom functions.

         Need registration for free tier. Please refer to [ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) for a quick start.

      - [Pinggy](https://pinggy.io/)

         Free to try without registration. Please refer to [pinggy documentation](https://pinggy.io/docs/) for a quick start.

    > :exclamation: In macOS, you may use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to easily install some of the tools above.

2. Access to AGS environment.

   a. Base URL
   
      - For `Shared Cloud` tier e.g.  https://spaceshooter.prod.gamingservices.accelbyte.io
      - For `Private Cloud` tier e.g.  https://dev.accelbyte.io
      
   b. [Create a Game Namespace](https://docs.accelbyte.io/gaming-services/services/access/reference/namespaces/manage-your-namespaces/) if you don't have one yet. Keep the `Namespace ID`.

   c. [Create an OAuth Client](https://docs.accelbyte.io/gaming-services/services/access/authorization/manage-access-control-for-applications/#create-an-iam-client) with confidential client type. Keep the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

## Setup

To be able to run this app, you will need to follow these setup steps.

1. Create a docker compose `.env` file by copying the content of 
   [.env.template](.env.template) file.

   > :warning: **The host OS environment variables have higher precedence compared to `.env` file variables**: If the variables in `.env` file do not seem to take 
   effect properly, check if there are host OS environment variables with the 
   same name. See documentation about 
   [docker compose environment variables precedence](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/envvars-precedence/) 
   for more details.

2. Fill in the required environment variables in `.env` file as shown below.

   ```
   AB_BASE_URL=https://test.accelbyte.io     # Base URL of AccelByte Gaming Services environment
   AB_CLIENT_ID='xxxxxxxxxx'                 # Client ID from the Prerequisites section
   AB_CLIENT_SECRET='xxxxxxxxxx'             # Client Secret from the Prerequisites section
   AB_NAMESPACE='xxxxxxxxxx'                 # Namespace ID from the Prerequisites section
   PLUGIN_GRPC_SERVER_AUTH_ENABLED=false     # Enable or disable access token validation
   ```

   > :exclamation: **In this app, PLUGIN_GRPC_SERVER_AUTH_ENABLED is `true` by default**: If it is set to `false`, the `gRPC server` can be invoked without an AGS access 
   token. This option is provided for development purpose only. It is 
   recommended to enable `gRPC server` access token validation in production 
   environment.

## Building

To build this app, use the following command.

```
make build
```

## Running

To (build and) run this app in a container, use the following command.

```
docker compose up --build
```

## Testing

### Test in Local Development Environment

> :warning: **To perform the following, make sure PLUGIN_GRPC_SERVER_AUTH_ENABLED is set to `false`**: Otherwise,
the gRPC request will be rejected by the `gRPC server`.

The custom functions in this app can be tested locally using [postman](https://www.postman.com/).

1. Run this app by using the command below.

   ```shell
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. Open `postman`, create a new `gRPC request`, and enter `localhost:6565` as server URL.

   > :warning: **If you are running [grpc-plugin-dependencies](https://github.com/AccelByte/grpc-plugin-dependencies) stack alongside this project as mentioned in [Test Observability](#test-observability)**: Use `localhost:10000` instead of `localhost:6565`. This way, the `gRPC server` will be called via `Envoy` service within `grpc-plugin-dependencies` stack instead of directly.

3. In `postman`, continue by selecting `OnSessionCreated` grpc call method and click `Invoke` button, this will start stream connection to the gRPC server.

4. Still in `postman`, continue sending parameters first to specify number of players in a match by copying sample `JSON` below and click `Send`.

   ```json
   {
    "session": {
        "session": {
            "id": "sessionid",
            "is_active": true,
            "namespace": "namespace",
            "created_by": "created_by"
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   Expected response when success the session will be returned back but will added `attributes` field like below:

   ```json
   {
    "session": {
        "session": {
            "id": "sessionid",
            "is_active": true,
            "namespace": "namespace",
            "created_by": "created_by",
            "attributes": {
                "SAMPLE": "value from GRPC server"
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

### Test with AccelByte Gaming Services

To test the app, which runs locally with AGS, the `gRPC server` needs to be connected to the internet. To do this without requiring public IP, you can use local tunnel service.

1. Run this app by using command below.

   ```shell
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. Expose `gRPC server` TCP port 6565 in local development environment to the internet. Simplest way to do this is by using local tunnel service provider.
   - Sign in to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and get your `authtoken` from the ngrok dashboard and set it up in your local environment.
      And, to expose `gRPC server` use following command:
      ```bash
      ngrok tcp 6565
      ```

   - **Or** alternatively, you can use [pinggy](https://pinggy.io/) and use only `ssh` command line to setup simple tunnel.
      Then to expose `gRPC server` use following command:
      ```bash
      ssh -p 443 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -R0:127.0.0.1:6565 tcp@a.pinggy.io
      ```

   Please take note of the tunnel forwarding URL, e.g., `http://0.tcp.ap.ngrok.io:xxxxx` or `tcp://xxxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.a.free.pinggy.link:xxxxx`.

   > :exclamation: You may also use other local tunnel service and different method to expose the gRPC server port (TCP) to the internet.

   > :warning: **If you are running [grpc-plugin-dependencies](https://github.com/AccelByte/grpc-plugin-dependencies) stack alongside this app as mentioned in [Test Observability](#test-observability)**: Run the above 
   command in `grpc-plugin-dependencies` directory instead of this app directory and change tunnel local port from 6565 to 10000.
   This way, the `gRPC server` will be called via `Envoy` service within `grpc-plugin-dependencies` stack instead of directly.

3. [Create an OAuth Client](https://docs.accelbyte.io/gaming-services/services/access/authorization/manage-access-control-for-applications/#create-an-iam-client) with `confidential` client type with the following permissions. Keep the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

   - For AGS Private Cloud customers:
      - ADMIN:NAMESPACE:{namespace}:SESSION:CONFIGURATION [CREATE,READ,UPDATE,DELETE]
      - ADMIN:NAMESPACE:{namespace}:INFORMATION:USER:* [DELETE]

   - For AGS Shared Cloud customers:
      - Session -> Custom Configuration (Read, Create, Update, Delete)
      - IAM -> Users (Delete)

   > :warning: **Oauth Client created in this step is different from the one from Prerequisites section:** It is required by the [Postman collection](demo/session-manager-demo.postman_collection.json) in the next step to register the `gRPC Server` URL and also to create and delete test users.

4. Import the [Postman collection](demo/session-manager-demo.postman_collection.json) into Postman to simulate the session manager flow. Follow the instructions in the Postman collection overview to set up the environment, using the Client ID and Client Secret from the previous step. Monitor the Extend app console log while the session manager flow is running.

## Deploying

After done testing, you may want to deploy this app to `AccelByte Gaming Services`.

1. [Create a new Extend Override App on Admin Portal](https://docs.accelbyte.io/gaming-services/services/extend/override/getting-started-with-cloudsave-validator-customization/#create-the-extend-app). Keep the `Repository URI`.

2. Download and setup [extend-helper-cli](https://github.com/AccelByte/extend-helper-cli/) (only if it has not been done previously).

3. Perform docker login with `extend-helper-cli` using the following command.

   ```
   extend-helper-cli dockerlogin --namespace <my-namespace> --app <my-app> --login
   ```

   > :exclamation: For your convenience, the above `extend-helper-cli` command can also be 
   copied from `Repository Authentication Command` under the corresponding app detail page.

4. Build and push app docker image to AccelByte ECR using the following command.
   
   ```
   extend-helper-cli image-upload --work-dir <my-project-dir> --namespace <my-namespace> -f Dockerfile --app <my-app> --image-tag v0.0.1
   ```

   > :warning: Make sure to perform docker login (step 3) before executing the above command.

5. Open Admin Portal, go to **Extend** -> **Overridable Features**. And then select the extend app.

6. To deploy selected image tag, click **Image Version History** and select desired image tag to be deployed.

7. Click **Deploy Image**, confirm the deployment and go back to App Detail by clicking **Cancel**.

8. Wait until app status is running.

### Test Observability

To be able to see the how the observability works in this app locally, there are few things that need be setup before performing tests.

1. Uncomment loki logging driver in [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml)

   ```
    # logging:
    #   driver: loki
    #   options:
    #     loki-url: http://host.docker.internal:3100/loki/api/v1/push
    #     mode: non-blocking
    #     max-buffer-size: 4m
    #     loki-retries: "3"
   ```

   > :warning: **Make sure to install docker loki plugin beforehand**: Otherwise,
   this project will not be able to run. This is required so that container logs
   can flow to the `loki` service within `grpc-plugin-dependencies` stack. 
   Use this command to install docker loki plugin: `docker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest --alias loki --grant-all-permissions`.

2. Clone and run [grpc-plugin-dependencies](https://github.com/AccelByte/grpc-plugin-dependencies) stack alongside this project. After this, Grafana 
will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AccelByte/grpc-plugin-dependencies.git
   cd grpc-plugin-dependencies
   docker-compose up
   ```

   > :exclamation: More information about [grpc-plugin-dependencies](https://github.com/AccelByte/grpc-plugin-dependencies) is available [here](https://github.com/AccelByte/grpc-plugin-dependencies/blob/main/README.md).

3. Perform testing. For example, by following [Test in Local Development Environment](#test-in-local-development-environment) or [Test with AccelByte Gaming Services](#test-with-accelbyte-gaming-services).

## Next Step

Proceed to create your own `Extend Override` app for `Session Manager function` by modifying this project. See [here](https://docs.accelbyte.io/gaming-services/services/extend/override/session-manager-function/) for more details.
